* Guido [I'm not a fan of religiously taking some idea to the extreme, and I try to be pragmatic in my design choices (but not *too* pragmatic, see the start of this sentence :-) ... its <Haskell> "purity" will always remain in the way of adoption. Having to come to grips with Monads just isn't worth it for most people.](http://beta.slashdot.org/story/190749)

* Guido [I almost never hear that complaint...](http://beta.slashdot.org/story/190749)

* [Python does not promote functional programming even though it works fairly well.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1017621/why-isnt-python-very-good-for-functional-programming)

* Guido [plus the lambda is slower than the list comprehension](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196)

* Guido [Why drop lambda? Most Python users are unfamiliar with Lisp or Scheme, so the name is confusing](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196)

* [whenever I program in Python the code invariably ends up being almost purely functional.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1017621/why-isnt-python-very-good-for-functional-programming)

* ["What is functional programming (FP), anyway?" ... Unfortunately, it is hard to get a consistent opinion on just what FP is, even from functional programmers themselves.](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-prog/index.html)

* ["Pure" functional languages eschew side-effects. This excludes the almost ubiquitous pattern in imperative languages of assigning first one, then another value to the same variable to track the program state.](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-prog/index.html)

* [The basic elements of FP in Python are the functions map(), reduce(), and filter(), and the operator lambda](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-prog/index.html)
