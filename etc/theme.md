# Progression

* Our common goals
  * the points we unequivocally agree on
  * if not, then you are not "doing it wrong" (you just have different goals)
  * to implement software efficiently
  * efficiently means
    * to arrive at a result as quickly as possible
    * to continually arrive at results as quickly as possible, over time (aka maintenance)
    * a program result is valid if the program does what we need it to do computationally (i.e. "the software makes me money!" is an invalid result (outside of our goal)
  * rather than tell you directly "why django sucks", I prefer to equip you with the skills and facts to determine your own conclusion. PS: I am personally keen to know of a different conclusion. I know of many others who are also. The prize is a big one.
    * better outcome
    * more productive combat

* along the way, visit some of the lies you have been told

  * insidious ones
    * "Having to come to grips with Monads just isn't worth it for most people."
    * "Why drop lambda? Most Python users are unfamiliar with Lisp or Scheme, so the name is confusing"
    * "Imperative vs functional programming"

  * awkward ones
    * "not a fan of religiously taking some idea to the extreme ... try to be pragmatic about ... design choices (but not *too* pragmatic, see the start of this sentence)"
    * The real world is mutable
   
  * funny ones
    * Django: The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines
    * Django emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself.


* what functional programming means
  * some practical consequences

* what monad means

* the false economy of dynamic typing

* imperative v fp

# Mistakes

* imperative programming vs FP
* you are being told lies and you are better than that, because I met you and it's not even a close call

* you used map on a list, but you did not use map for the general case, because if you did, you have a program bug (implement double-linked list using ST)

* functional programming is not about fewer lines, characters, pixels or any arbitrary metric that serves no practical purpose but to provide a distraction to those obsessed with their own articulation of pomposity

* "static typing does not catch my errors." When someone says this, they are implying that there are certain types of errors that static typing catches, and other types that it doesn't. It is fair to immediately interpret this statement as, "I do not know what static typing means."

* "static typing gets in my way"

  * hole-driven development

  * nobody ever writes programs where even a first approximation of a sensible static type system would get in the way.
