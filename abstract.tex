\title{Perhaps There Is A \tiny{much} Better Way}

In this talk, we will first agree to commonly accepted goals of software
development, then critique the tools by which we come to arrive at those goals.
We will be exploring tools and associated nomenclature that we may have never
seen or used before, so that you may later investigate further and develop an
understanding and opinion.

Subjects covered in detail include functional programming, abstraction and
parametricity.

We will also take a glance at some of the doo-doo that is written on the
internet about these subjects, so as to keep in check our means of critical
inquiry.
